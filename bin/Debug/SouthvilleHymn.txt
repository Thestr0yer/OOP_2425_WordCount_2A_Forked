SISC HYMN
Lyrics by: Violeta Revoltar
Music by: Gertrude Quibotes
Your belief in what we are
Wakens thought to go beyond far
Faith in what we can yet be
Gladdens, set our spirit free

Come let us to Southville sing
Stars and hearts and laurels bring. (2x)

Cheers for small beginnings
Guiding hands and gentle proddings
Fun and beauty all around
Heartfelt songs from Southville sound

Come let us to Southville sing
Stars and hearts and laurels bring. (2x)

Nations hope we are meant to be
Children of the world you'll see
as we walk through life each day
True to self we each will stay.

Come let us to Southville sing
Stars and hearts and laurels bring. (2x)
